# Muesliswap Orders

Muesliswap is a hybrid decentralized exchange offering orderbook based liquidity as well as (Uniswap-style) AMM DEX architecure liquidity - just like Minswap, Sundaeswap etc.

This library only supports creating datums and redeemers for swap order transactions that make use of Muesliswap's liquidity pools.
